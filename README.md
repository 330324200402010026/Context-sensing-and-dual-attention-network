# Context-sensing-and-dual-attention-network
A module that designed in my undergraduate thesis, for the tasks about scene classification of remote sensing image.

split.py
In this model, datasets are splited into three parts, including train, verify, and test, in any ratio you need.

CACRWNet.py
Code in this model shows the main part of the whole module. The general idea of thie module is to integrate the multi-scale features of the backbone network, to enhance the multi-scale information of the features.
